Today, we'll create a Guess My Number game and learn about loops

See slides [here](../presentation-pdfs/day9.pdf).

The Guess My Number game is split into three stages:

[Stage 1](../code_snippets/guess-my-number-stage-1.html)

[Stage 2](../code_snippets/guess-my-number-stage-2.html)

[Stage 3](../code_snippets/guess-my-number-stage-3.html)
