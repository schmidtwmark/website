## Requirements

For your Final Project, you will be extending the Messages app into a *Personal Assistant*. The *Personal Assistant* will have several features, some of which you have already accomplished!

1. Sending messages (`send`)
2. View message inbox (`inbox`)
3. View conversation with another user (`messages`)
4. A feature of your choice from the list below
5. A second feature from the list below **OR** a custom feature of your choice (pending my approval)

Conversation and collaboration is encouraged, but you MUST work alone. 

## Features

I've implemented basic forms of each feature. It is up to you to integrate it into your Personal Assistant app and make some improvements!

Each feature links to some sample code you can use as a starting point.
