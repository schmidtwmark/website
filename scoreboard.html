    <h2 class="accent-class text-center">Background & History</h2>
    <p class="">For Valentine’s Day 2019, I used <a
        href="https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard">this</a> excellent open source guide to make an
      MLB
      Scoreboard for my St. Louis
      sports
      fanatic wife. While she loves the Cardinals, her one true love is the St. Louis Blues. So, when she asked if there
      was
      any way I could get her scoreboard to show hockey in addition to baseball, I gave it a shot. She loved it, and
      asked
      if this
      was something I could possibly make and sell to other people. What started as a quick weekend project turned into
      a year
      long learning experience pulling in all my software engineering skills.</p>
    <p>To turn this into a real product, I would have to make it mom and dad friendly—no need to solder anything, no
      need to
      configure things, update packages, or anything remotely technical. I needed to 3D print an enclosure, wire up a
      button,
      and write thousands of lines of code to support the onboarding process.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a great learning opportunity for me—I learned how to use Flutter to make a cross platform controller app,
      how
      to use AWS and GraphQL to host a Scoreboard API, and put dozens of other skills to the test to make a final
      product that
      I’m very proud of.
