# Scoreboard 2.1.0

Fore! Golf makes its way to the Schmidt Scoreboard. Get your game on, go play the new Flappy Bird game! 

## Golf

Golf mode is the first individual sport I’ve added to the Schmidt Scoreboard. It displays the name of the event and the top 4 players, and will fetch updates as the game progresses.

Because golf doesn’t have teams, it is not possible to set favorite teams. To get golf events to lock focus and automatically turn on power with Magic Power, toggle the new “Prioritize Golf” button in the settings, seen below.

Please let me know how this new mode works, and if you’d like to see any changes to the layout or content displayed. I’m always open to suggestions!

## Flappy Bird

For fun and to prove that I could, I threw in a Flappy Bird knockoff. It’s super simple—tap the Play button in the Other section to open the Flappy screen, then keep tapping the Play button to start the game and make the character bounce.

I’d love to see any impressive high scores! You can message them to me at [mark.schmidt@hey.com](mailto:mark.schmidt@hey.com)

## Auto-Updates

Your Scoreboard will now automatically restart each morning at 3AM local time. This has several benefits:

1. Stabilizes network configuration
2. Ensures your scoreboard always stays up to date with the latest software.

## What’s Next?

I’ve got a few potential features that I’d love feedback on. You can find the survery [here](https://4jqaknpki6r.typeform.com/to/jQbcwAn9) if you haven’t filled it out. 

Currently, my plan is:

1. Crypto/Stock price tickers
2. Clock revamp with local weather
3. Olympics mode (show medal count for top countries). I’ve got 100 days to get this one done!

As always, please reach out with any feedback.

Thanks,
Mark Schmidt
