# Scoreboard 2.3.0

Customize your Scoreboard like never before!
## Custom Image


A long awaited feature, you can now use your Scoreboard to show a custom image or message. Use it to show a seasonal greeting, a QR code for your home WiFi network, an image of your beloved pets, your favorite meme, or anything else you’d like! Here's just a few of the images I've tried that look great:

To set your custom image, *long press on the new “message” icon on the home screen*. This will bring up the Custom Message Editor. You can set a background for your message and add text. Customize text size and color for each line, and add blank lines to add spacing.

If you need more advanced controls, try using a pixel art editor. I like Pixaki Intro for iPad, or Piskel on any web browser. Draw your new background, output it as a PNG, and use the Scoreboard app to send it to your Scoreboard. Your output image should be a multiple of 64x32 like 640x320. (There’s a bug in Apple’s image picker that adds random noise to low-resolution images).

In addition, you can choose to show your Custom Message as your default screen saver instead of the Scoreboard turning off when there are no favorite teams playing and Magic Power is enabled.

Note that if you currently have your scoreboard set to show the clock when it would Magic Power off, you'll have to reset the setting at the menu above.

Also, there is a minor bug that is fixed but may be present on whichever version of the update your Scoreboard happened to receive. The default message when you activate Custom Message mode will have cut-off text on a green background. That's not intentional, and is fixed in 2.3.1, which is already out. 


## Better Football

With football season starting soon, I’ve laid the ground work for extra stats in the college and professional football screens.

Note that it may take some time after the season starts for these stats to appear.

## What’s Next

This is the last of my planned updates for the Schmidt Scoreboard. I’ve loved developing this little project into a product that people can buy, but it’s time to move on to other exciting projects.

I’m happy with the state of the features—with Golf, Basketball, Football, Custom Messages, and all the other updates added in the last year, Schmidt Scoreboard is an awesome, fully featured product. I’ll continue to sell Schmidt Scoreboards as they are ordered for the foreseeable future and will provide product support and bug fixes for as long as I can, but don’t expect additional features or modes in the coming months.

Thank you so very much to all of my customers. I dearly appreciate how each of you took a chance on an untested, lone developer making a  unique product. I hope you’ve enjoyed having your Scoreboard as much as I’ve enjoyed building it. 

Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions—just because I’m not planning additional features doesn’t mean I can’t be drawn back in by a solid idea. And of course, if you are having issues, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email so we can get it resolved as soon as possible.


Thanks again,

Mark Schmidt
