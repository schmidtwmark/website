## What's new?

So many new things! This is the biggest update to Schmidt Scoreboard since the initial release.

1. **Football and College Football** are now available (though games won't start for a while)
2. **Automatic Mode** shows games from all different sports. When the Cubs and the Blackhawks are playing at the same time, you can keep track of both games!
3. **Magic Power** will turn your scoreboard on and off automatically whenever your favorite teams play. Set it to Auto Mode with Magic Power, and you will never miss a game from any of your favorite teams across all leagues.
4. **App Adaptability** includes many changes to make the app more responsive across various devices. Try it on your iPad or Android tablet, or try turning your phone into landscape mode!
5. **Font Touch-Ups** ensure that Y's, T's, N's and other letters have proper spacing in team names, for a much cleaner look.

This update took a ton of work to make the features above work, and includes an upgrade to Flutter 2 to support the new app, reworks to both the AWS server and the Scoreboard software to speed up fetching games, and a lot more under-the-hood work to make Scoreboard even better.

## What's Next?

In this marathon update, I've included a lot of features that I planned to release over the course of 2021. [Here](https://4jqaknpki6r.typeform.com/to/jQbcwAn9) is a link to a survey where I can gauge interest on what features are most interesting; I'd really appreciate it if you filled it out!
