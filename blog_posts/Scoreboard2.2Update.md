# Scoreboard 2.2.0

Another smorgasbord of updates for your Schmidt Scoreboard!

## Baseball on-base

This update brings a much-requested improvement to Baseball games: an on base indicator! Now, you can be even more up to date than ever before! This requires adding your baseball teams as favorites again because it uses a different data source. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

I’m excited to bring features like this to other sports, such as down and yardage indicators for football.

## Magic Power Clock

With this new setting and Magic Power enabled, your scoreboard will show the clock when there are no priority games active. Makes sure your Scoreboard is useful even when there's no sports to worry about. Enjoy your personalized feature, Brian!

## Improved Loading/Troubleshooting in App

It’s easy to accidentally end up in the Setup mode if your Scoreboard fails to connect during a reboot or when your device is not on the correct WiFi network.

Scoreboard 2.2.0 brings a few features to help with this:

1. A new loading screen that will not immediately advise you that something is wrong with your Scoreboard when it cannot connect for ordinary reasons
2. A better Troubleshooting menu on the loading and error screen that provides more detailed instructions.
2. If you do mistakenly find yourself back in Setup mode for a functional Scoreboard, you can tap the back button in the top left to exit Setup without making changes.

## Better Flappy Bird

I wasn’t happy with the state of Flappy Bird in 2.1.0. I went back and made it more fun, with feedback from Richard.

## What’s Next?

This update was a detour from my original plan, but made a lot of necessary improvements. I’d love to hear what you would like to see next!

Thanks,
Mark Schmidt
