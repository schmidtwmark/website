# Introducing BetterBlue
<link href="index.css" rel="stylesheet">

I'm excited to release BetterBlue, an iOS native app for connecting to Hyundai and Kia vehicles. My wife and I have a Kia Carnival and Hyundai Ioniq 5, respectively--since getting them, we have been disappointed with the manufacturer apps.

I built BetterBlue to fix some of the downsides of the manufacturer apps. In BetterBlue, all the information you need about your car is right there. The main controls you want -- door locks, climate controls, charging controls -- are all accessible as soon as you open the app. The app has a functional Apple Watch companion, and supports Widgets and Shortcuts. Finally, I can ask Siri to start my car for me!

Building BetterBlue was an interesting experience, as it was my first time really using AI coding agents. I tried out Cursor, but found it struggled with Swift and iOS development. Claude Code was much, much more capable. After using these tools, I believe the reports of the death of the software engineering profession are greatly overexaggerated. Claude Code was a net benefit to my productivity, but it is clearly incapable of building this whole thing by itself.

If you use the app and have any feedback, please reach out at [mark.schmidt@hey.com](mailto://mark.schmidt@hey.com). I always appreciate receiving feedback!
